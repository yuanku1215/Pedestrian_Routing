# 📁 Raw Data Upload Instructions

This guide explains how to upload, create, delete, and edit files inside the repository.  
You do **not** need to know Git commands — everything can be done from the GitHub website.

---

## ✅ 1. Upload Files (Most Common)

📌 *Use this when you want to upload datasets such as road network, sidewalks, POI, accidents, etc.*

1. Open the folder where you want to upload  
   → Example: `data/raw/road_network/`
2. Click **➕ Add file → Upload files**
3. Drag your files into the upload window  
   (You can upload multiple files at once)
4. Add a short commit message  
   Example: `Add NCKU road network dataset`
5. Click **Commit changes**

✔ The files will be uploaded to the repository.

## 📂 2. Create a New Folder

GitHub does not have a direct “new folder” button.  
A folder is created **when you create a new file inside it**.

Example: Create folder:  
`data/raw/obstacles/ramps/`

Steps:

1. Go to: `data/raw/obstacles/`
2. Click **➕ Add file → Create new file**
3. In the file name field, type:

```
ramps/.gitkeep
```

4. Add a commit message  
5. Click **Commit changes**

✔ A new folder named **ramps** will be created automatically.

---

## 🗑️ 3. Delete a File

1. Open the file you want to delete  
2. Click the **🗑 Delete this file** icon (top-right)  
3. Add a short commit message  
   Example: `Remove outdated dataset`
4. Click **Commit changes**

✔ The file will be deleted from the repository.

---

## ✏️ 4. Edit an Existing File (e.g., README)

1. Open the file you want to edit  
   (For example: `data/raw/README.md`)
2. Click the **✏️ Edit this file** icon (top-right)
3. Modify the content
4. Add a commit message
5. Click **Commit changes**

✔ Your changes will be saved.
